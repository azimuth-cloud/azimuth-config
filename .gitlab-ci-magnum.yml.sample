# This job checks to see if there is a new release that needs to be merged
#
# If there is, it will create a new branch containing the changes and a corresponding merge request
#
# It runs as a scheduled job, for which a suitable schedule must be defined, e.g. daily or weekly
#
# This job writes back to the repository and to the merge requests API
# To do this, it needs more power than is granted to the CI token
# So CI variables must be set that contain an access token and the corresponding username
# This can be a Project Access Token (paid feature, recommended if available) or a Personal Access Token (not ideal)

# This job deploys a staging/test version of the Magnum CAPI management cluster
#
# It runs automatically for every commit to main that changes one of the files
# that affects the environment.
# 
# NOTE: If the target site doesn't have a separate staging cloud with it's own Magnum
# deployment then it may still be worth including a management cluster staging env in
# this config repo which is a stripped down (1 master, 1 worker) version of the prod
# env. Although this will not allow for testing the interaction between Magnum and the
# CAPI management cluster, it will at least validate the deployment config before a
# production rollout is performed.
