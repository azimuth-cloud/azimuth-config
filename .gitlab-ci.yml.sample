# This job checks to see if there are changes from upstream to be merged
#
# If there are, it will create a new branch containing the changes and a corresponding merge request
#
# It runs as a scheduled job, for which a suitable schedule must be defined, e.g. daily or weekly
#
# This job writes back to the repository and to the merge requests API
# To do this, it needs more power than is granted to the CI token
# So CI variables must be set that contain an access token and the corresponding username
# This can be a Project Access Token (paid feature) or a Personal Access Token (not ideal)

# This job deploys a dynamic review environment for the current branch
#
# Runs for every commit to every branch except main
#
# Each environment is a single node deployment that is isolated from the other
# branches with it's own GitLab environment, Terraform state and OpenStack resources
# (although they do share an OpenStack project)
#
# This allows configuration changes to be tested  before being merged to main,
# subject to the differences between the aio and staging/production environments
#
# It is recommended to use a site mixin for the common configuration to increase the
# efficacy of this process!
