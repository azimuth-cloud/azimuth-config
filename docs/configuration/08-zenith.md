# Zenith Application Proxy

The Zenith application proxy is enabled by default in the reference configuration. To disable
it, just set:

```yaml  title="environments/my-site/inventory/group_vars/all/variables.yml"
azimuth_apps_enabled: no
```

The only piece of configuration that is required for Zenith is a secret key that is used
to sign and verify the single-use tokens issued by the registrar (see the Zenith architecture
document for details):

```yaml  title="environments/my-site/inventory/group_vars/all/secrets.yml"
zenith_registrar_subdomain_token_signing_key: "<some secret key>"
```

!!! tip

    This key should be a long, random string - at least 32 bytes (256 bits) is recommended.
    A suitable key can be generated using `openssl rand -hex 32`.

!!! danger

    This key should be kept secret. If you want to keep it in Git - which is recommended - then
    it [must be encrypted](../repository/secrets.md).

##Â SSHD port number

By default, the Zenith SSHD server will use port `22` on a dedicated IP address for a HA
deployment and port `2222` on the pre-allocated floating IP for a single node deployment
(port `22` is used for regular SSH to configure the node).

This can be changed using the following variable, if required:

```yaml  title="environments/my-site/inventory/group_vars/all/variables.yml"
zenith_sshd_service_port: 22222
```
