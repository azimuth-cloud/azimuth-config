# Azimuth configuration repository

The `azimuth-config` repository provides best-practice configuration for Azimuth deployments
that can be inherited by site-specific configuration repositories using
[Git](https://git-scm.com/). Using Git makes it easy to pick up new Azimuth releases when
they become available.

## Initial repository setup

First make an empty Git repository using your service of choice (e.g.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)), then execute the
following commands to turn the new empty repository into a copy of the `azimuth-config`
repository:

```sh
# Clone the azimuth-config repository
git clone https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/azimuth-config.git my-azimuth-config
cd my-azimuth-config

# Maintain the existing origin remote as upstream
git remote rename origin upstream

# Create a new origin remote for the repository location
git remote add origin git@<repo location>/my-azimuth-config.git

# Create a new main branch from devel
# This will be the branch that is deployed into production
git checkout -b main

# Push the main branch to the origin
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

You now have an independent copy of the `azimuth-config` repository that has a link back
to the source repository via the `upstream` remote.

!!! tip  "Branch protection rules"

    It is a good idea to apply branch protection rules to the `main` branch that enforce
    that all changes are made via a merge (or pull) request. This should ensure that changes
    are not accidentally pushed into production without being reviewed.

    Instructions are available on how to set this up for
    [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) or
    [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html).


## Creating a new environment

Your new repository does not yet contain any site-specific configuration. The best way
to do this is to copy the `example` environment as a starting point:

```sh
cp -r ./environments/example ./environments/my-site
```

!!! tip

    Copying the `example` environment, rather than just renaming it, avoids conflicts
    when synchronising changes from the `azimuth-config` repository where the `example`
    environment has changed.

Once you have your new environment, you can make the required changes for your site.

As you make changes to your environment, remember to commit and push them regularly:

```sh
git add ./environments/my-site
git commit -m "Made some changes to my environment"
git push
```

## Making changes to your configuration

Once you have an environment deployed, it is recommended to use a
[feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
when making changes to your configuration repository.

!!! tip "Automated deployments"

    The feature branch workflow works particularly well when you use a
    [continuous delivery approach to automate deployments](../deployment/automation.md).

In this workflow, the required changes are made on a branch in the configuration repository.
Once you are happy with the changes, you create a merge (or pull) request proposing the
changes to `main`. These changes can then be reviewed before being merged to `main`.

If you have automated deployments, the branch may even get a dynamic environment created
for it where the result of the changes can be verified before the merge takes place.

## Upgrading to a new Azimuth release

When a new Azimuth release becomes available, you will need to synchronise the changes
from `azimuth-config` into your site configuration repository in order to pick up new
component versions, upgraded dependencies and new images.

!!! info  "Choosing a release"

    The available releases, with associated release notes, can be reviewed on the
    [Azimuth releases page](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/azimuth-config/releases).

!!! tip  "Automating upgrades"

    If you have automated deployments, which is recommended for a production installation,
    this process
    [can also be automated](../deployment/automation.md#automated-synchronisation-of-upstream-changes).

To upgrade your Azimuth configuration to a new release, use the following steps to create
a new branch containing the upgrade:

```sh
# Make sure the local checkout is up to date with any site-specific changes
git checkout main
git pull

# Fetch the tags from the upstream repo
git remote update

# Create a new branch to contain the Azimuth upgrade
git checkout -b upgrade/$RELEASE_TAG

# Merge in the tag for the new release
git merge $RELEASE_TAG
```

At this point, you will need to fix any conflicts where you have made changes to the same
files that have been changed by `azimuth-config`.

!!! danger  "Avoiding conflicts"

    To avoid conflicts, you should **never** directly modify any files that come from
    `azimuth-config` - instead you should use the environment layering to override
    variables where required, and copy files if necessary.

Once any conflicts have been resolved, you can commit and push the changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Upgrade Azimuth to $RELEASE_TAG"
git push --set-upstream origin upgrade/$RELEASE_TAG
```

You can now open a merge (or pull) request proposing the upgrade to your `main` branch
that can be reviewed like any other.
