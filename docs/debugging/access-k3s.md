# Accessing the K3S cluster

Both the single node and high-availability (HA) deployment methods have a K3S node that
is provisioned using Terraform. In the single node case, this is the cluster that actually
hosts Azimuth and all its dependencies. In the HA case, this cluster is configured as a
Cluster API management cluster for the HA cluster that actually runs Azimuth.

In both cases, the K3S node is deployed using Terraform and the IP address and SSH key
for accessing the node are in the Terraform state for the environment. The `azimuth-config`
repository contains a utility script - 
[seed-ssh](https://github.com/stackhpc/azimuth-config/tree/stable/bin/seed-ssh) - that will
extract these details from the Terraform state for the active environment and use them to
execute an SSH command to access the provisioned node.

Once on the node, you can use `kubectl` to inspect the state of the Kubernetes cluster. It
is already configured with the correct kubeconfig file:

```console
$ ./bin/seed-ssh
ubuntu@azimuth-staging-seed:~$ kubectl get po -A
