# Debugging Zenith services

If a Zenith service does not become available, the most common causes are:

##Â Client not registering correctly with SSHD

To determine if this is the case, it is useful to access the [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
UI. Similar to the monitoring, this interface is only accessible inside the cluster. To
access it, use the following command:

```sh
./bin/port-forward consul 3000
```

The Consul UI will then be available at <http://localhost:3000>. The default view shows
Consul's view of the services, where you can check if the service is being registered
correctly.

If the client is not correctly registering with SSHD, the first thing to do is check the
logs for the client and restart it if necessary. If the client is failing to connect to
SSHD, then try restarting SSHD:

```sh  title="On the K3S node, targetting the HA cluster if deployed"
kubectl -n azimuth rollout restart deployment/zenith-server-sshd
```

Clients not registering correctly with SSHD may also be caused by a Consul outage. Futher
information for debugging Consul issues is provided in [Debugging Consul](consul.md).

## Kubernetes resources for the Zenith service have not been created

If the service exists in Consul, it is possible that the process that synchronises Consul
services with Kubernetes resources is not functioning correctly. To check if Kubernetes
resources are being created, run the following command and check that the `Ingress`,
`Service` and `Endpoints` resources have been created for the service:

```command  title="On the K3S node, targetting the HA cluster if deployed"
$ kubectl -n zenith-services get ingress,service,endpoints

!!! tip

    If an ingress resource does not have an IP, this may be a sign that the ingress controller
    is not correctly configured or not functioning correctly.

If they do not exist, try restarting the Zenith sync component:

```sh  title="On the K3S node, targetting the HA cluster if deployed"
kubectl -n azimuth rollout restart deployment/zenith-server-sync
```

## cert-manager fails to obtain a certificate

If you are using cert-manager to dynamically allocate certificates for Zenith services it
is possible that cert-manager has failed to obtain a certificate for the service, e.g. because
it has been rate-limited.

To check if this is the case, check the state of the certificates for the Zenith services:

```command  title="On the K3S node, targetting the HA cluster if deployed"
$ kubectl -n zenith-services get certificate
NAME                                      READY   SECRET                                    AGE
tls-cjzm03yczuj6oqrj3h8htl4u1bbx96qd53g   True    tls-cjzm03yczuj6oqrj3h8htl4u1bbx96qd53g   2d
tls-i03xvflgk1zmtcsdm2x5z5lz9qz05027euw   True    tls-i03xvflgk1zmtcsdm2x5z5lz9qz05027euw   2d
tls-txn3zidfdnru5rg109voh848n51rvicmr1s   True    tls-txn3zidfdnru5rg109voh848n51rvicmr1s   2d
```

If the certificate for the service is not ready, check the details for the certificate using
`kubectl describe` and check for any errors that have occured.
