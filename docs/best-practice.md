# Best practice for production deployments

This document guides you through the process of setting up a production-ready Azimuth
deployment following recommended best practice.

## Repository

Before building your Azimuth configuration, you must first
[set up your configuration repository](./repository/index.md), including initialising
`git-crypt` for [encrypting secrets](./repository/secrets.md).

It is recommended to use a
[feature branch workflow](./repository/index.md#making-changes-to-your-configuration)
to make changes to your Azimuth configuration in a controlled way.

## Environments

An Azimuth configuration repository contains multiple [environments](./environments.md),
some of which contain common configuration ("mixin" environments), and some of which
represent a deployment ("concrete" environments).

For a production deployment of Azimuth, there should be _at least two_ concrete environments
that are deployed from the `main` branch:

  * `production` - the Azimuth deployment that is provided to end users
  * `staging` - used to validate changes before pushing to production

Both of these environments should be
[highly-available](./configuration/02-deployment-method.md#highly-available-ha) deployments,
in order to fully test the upgrade process.

It is recommended to have a
[single node](./configuration/02-deployment-method.md#single-node) `aio` environment that
also follows the `production` environment as closely as possible. This can be used for
testing changes to the configuration before they are merged to `main`.

In order for validation in the `aio` and `staging` environments to be meaningful, the
configuration of these environments should be as similar to `production` as possible.
To do this, two site-specific mixins should be used:

  * `site` - contains configuration that is common between `aio`, `staging` and `production`,
    e.g. enabled features, available platforms
  * `site-ha` - contains configuration for the HA setup that is common between `staging`
    and `production`

The environments would then be layered as follows:

```
base --> singlenode --> site --> aio
base --> ha --> site --> site-ha --> staging
base --> ha --> site --> site-ha --> production
```

with only necessary differences configured in each environment, e.g. the ingress base domain, between `staging` and `production`.

## OpenStack projects

Azimuth is usually deployed on the cloud that is being targeted for workloads. It is
recommended to have three OpenStack projects for a production Azimuth deployment, to contain:

  * A highly-available (HA) production deployment, e.g. `azimuth-production`
  * A HA staging deployment, e.g. `azimuth-staging`
  * All-in-one (AIO) deployments for validating changes, e.g. `azimuth-cicd`

The production and staging projects must have
[sufficient quota](./configuration/01-prerequisites.md#prerequisites) for a HA Azimuth
deployment. The required quota in the CI/CD project will depend on the number of
proposed changes that are open concurrently.

Users that login to Azimuth will see a list of the OpenStack projects
they can access. Any OpenStack project can be used to deploy Azimuth
workloads, as long as the networking requirements have been met.
Azimuth creates application credentials to be able to create the
user workloads using the appropriate automation.

## Deployment Prerequisites

Before proceeding with an Azimuth [deployment](./deployment/index.md),
you should ensure that you can fulfil
[all the prerequisites](./configuration/01-prerequisites.md).

The prerequisites include verifying that the target cloud has the required features available,
generating OpenStack application credentials
and ensuring that the required DNS records and TLS certificates are available.

## OpenTofu state

Azimuth deployments use [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), an open-source fork of
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), to manage some parts of the infrastructure.

A [remote state store](./repository/opentofu.md#remote-state) must be configured in
order to persist the OpenTofu state across playbook executions. If GitLab is being
used for the Azimuth configuration repository, it is recommended to use
[GitLab-managed Terraform state](./repository/opentofu.md#gitlab) for this. If not,
[S3](./repository/opentofu.md#s3) is the preferred approach.

## Continuous delivery

A production Azimuth deployment should use [continuous delivery](./deployment/automation.md),
where changes to the configuration are automatically deployed to the `aio` and `staging`
environments. The `ansible-playbook` command should **never** be executed manually.

The recommended approach is to automatically deploy an independent `aio` environment for each
feature branch, also known as
[per-branch dynamic review environments](deployment/automation/#per-branch-dynamic-review-environments).
This allows changes to be validated before they are merged to `main`.

Once a change is merged to `main`, it will be deployed automatically to the `staging` environment.
Merging to `main` will also create a job to deploy to `production`, but that job will require a
manual trigger. Once the change has been validated in `staging`, the job to deploy to `production`
can be actioned.

It is also possible to run [integration tests](./deployment/testing.md) against a
deployment. It is recommended that this is configured to run automatically for at least
`aio` and `staging` environments. It should also be safe to run against `production` as
long as the tests are configured to target an isolated project.

A
[sample GitLab CI/CD configuration](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/azimuth-config/tree/stable/.gitlab-ci.yml.sample)
is provided that implements this workflow for GitLab-hosted repositories.

## Monitoring

Before going into production, be sure you can
[access the monitoring](./debugging/access-monitoring.md).

Also ensure you have
[configured alert manager](./configuration/14-monitoring.md)
such that you will notice any alerts on staging and production.

## Disaster recovery

Azimuth uses [Velero](https://velero.io/) to backup the data that is required to restore an
Azimuth instance in the event of a catastrophic failure. This functionality is not enabled by
default, as it requires credentials for an S3 bucket in which the backups will be stored.

It is recommended that [disaster recovery is enabled](./configuration/15-disaster-recovery.md) for
a production deployment.

## Configuration

You are now ready to begin adding configuration to your environments. When building an environment
for the first time, it is recommended to follow each documentation page in order, beginning with
the [Deployment method](./configuration/02-deployment-method.md).

!!! tip

    Remember to share as much configuration as possible between all your [environments](./environments.md)!
